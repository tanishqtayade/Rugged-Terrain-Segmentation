# Rugged-Terrain-Segmentation
Semantic segmentation enables machines to understand complex and unstructured environments by labeling regions of an image at the pixel level.  While many computer vision benchmarks focus on structured, road-based scenes, real-world applications such as off-road navigation and robotics require models that can operate reliably in rugged terrain.
